  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>Welcome to my website. If you're here, you probably know me in person, but just in case you don't, let's do some quick introductions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, I'm Sailesh, a developer with a Computing Science degree from Aston University, who builds websites and software. You can find out more about what I do on the <a href="/about">about</a> page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My plan is for this site to act as a portfolio site, where I'll write about side projects that I'll be working. I'll also likely write some blog posts with occasional life updates.</p>
<p>My first blog post will likely be about my final year project, a chatbot to aid the university admissions process, which was a fun, yet very stressful project; it was also the first project which I took from ideation to deployment so there will be some interesting stories about that journey as well as some development stories about what did and didn't go well.</p>
<p>If you'd like to get in touch with me, you can email me at <a href="mailto:sailesh@saileshpatel.xyz">sailesh@saileshpatel.xyz</a> and I'll get back to you.</p>
