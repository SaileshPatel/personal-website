Welcome to my website. If you're here, you probably know me in person, but just in case you don't, let's do introductions. 

Hi, I'm Sailesh, a developer from Birmingham, UK, who has a degree in Computing Science from Aston University, and 

My plan for this site is to act as a portfolio site, where I'll be writing about side projects I'm currently working on.
