Welcome to my website. If you're here, you probably know me in person, but just in case you don't, let's do some quick introductions. 

> Hello, I'm Sailesh, a developer with a Computing Science degree from Aston University, who builds websites and software. You can find out more about what I do on the [about](/about) page.

My plan is for this site to act as a portfolio site, where I'll write about side projects that I'll be working. I'll also likely write some blog posts with occasional life updates. 

My first blog post will likely be about my final year project, a chatbot to aid the university admissions process, which was a fun, yet very stressful project; it was also the first project which I took from ideation to deployment so there will be some interesting stories about that journey as well as some development stories about what did and didn't go well.

If you'd like to get in touch with me, you can email me at [sailesh@saileshpatel.xyz](mailto:sailesh@saileshpatel.xyz) and I'll get back to you.
