Welcome to my website. If you're here, you probably know me in person, but just in case you don't, let's do some quick introductions. 

> Hi, I'm Sailesh, a developer from Birmingham, UK, who has a degree in Computing Science from Aston University, and builds websites and software. You can find out more about me on the [about](/about) page.

My plan for this site is to act as a portfolio site, where I'll be writing about side projects I'm currently working on. I'll also write some blog blogs with life updates ocassionally.

My first blog post will be about my final year project, a chatbot to aid the University admissions process. Although this project caused some major headaches, it was a really fulfilling project as it was the first time that I have ever taken a project from ideation to deployment, so there'll be some interesting stories about this.
