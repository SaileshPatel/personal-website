As part of my Computing Science degree from Aston University, I had to complete a final year project; these projects need to involve two steps of the software development lifecycle and testing needs to be conducted. Final year projects are 40 credit projects, which are primarily independent study, and can either be chosen from a life provided by a supervisor or can be proposed by the student themselves.

I chose my final year project, which was titled *A chatbot to assist the university admissions process*, from a list of projects offered by my project supervisor. After selecting this project, I was assigned this project as my final year project; had I not been successful, one of my other choices would have been allocated as my final year project.

At the start of the project, the decision was made to focus on clearing - a process where students who did not obtain their first or insurance (second) choice of university course can attempt to find places on other courses. As a result of this and a series of knowledge elicitation activities (including interviews and informal conversations), a series of requirements were formed and a prototype of a chatbot that focuses on clearing was created.
