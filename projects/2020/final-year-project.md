This project was produced as the deliverable for the Individual Project module (CS3010), completed as part of my studies at Aston University. 

There are two deliverables which can both be found on GitHub: 
* [The chatbot system](https://github.com/SaileshPatel/clearing-chatbot-system-fyp)
* [The programme scraper](https://github.com/SaileshPatel/programme-specification-scraper) 

The final year project deliverable was a chatbot aid the University admissions process. The main focus for this project was clearing admissions, which take place after qualification results have been released.
